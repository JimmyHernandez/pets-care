### Project Overview

This web application is for educational purposes, especially on animal issues and their care. It will teach pet owners how to care for their pets according to their species and breed. They may create a profile of the pet for the purposes of helping to find your pet if it strays in a faster and more direct way.

### Our Mission

Our mission is to be able to create a web application where the user can have access to valuable information about their pet. How to feed, bathe and vaccinate them are essential to have healthy pets.
